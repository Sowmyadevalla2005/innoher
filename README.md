echo "# InnoHer Climate Risk Analysis Tool

## Introduction
The **InnoHer Climate Risk Analysis Tool** is an AI-powered climate risk analysis system specifically designed for the insurance industry. It collects climate data and news, processes the information using natural language processing, and generates risk assessment reports to help insurance companies better understand and prepare for climate-related risks. The system provides data-driven insights about climate-related risks that may impact insurance policies and claims.

## How It Works
The application follows these steps to provide risk assessments:
1. **Data Collection**: The app gathers weather data from multiple cities and climate news articles from reliable sources.
2. **Text Processing**: News articles are analyzed for sentiment and relevance to climate risks.
3. **Risk Assessment**: The system evaluates and categorizes climate risks based on the collected data.
4. **Report Generation**: Comprehensive reports are created highlighting top climate risks for insurance consideration.

## Features
* **Data Collection**: Automatically gathers weather data from multiple cities and climate news articles
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes news sentiment to identify potential risks
* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates and categorizes climate risks based on collected data
* **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive markdown reports highlighting top climate risks

## Models and APIs Used
The **InnoHer Climate Risk Analysis Tool** utilizes the following models and APIs:
1. **Hugging Face Transformers**:
   - The application leverages models from the Hugging Face Transformers library for sentiment analysis and risk classification tasks.
   - The system uses DistilBERT for efficient text processing and classification.

2. **External Weather and News APIs**:
   - OpenWeatherMap API for collecting current weather data
   - NewsAPI for gathering climate-related news articles

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/Sowmyadevalla2005/innoher.git
cd innoher
\`\`\`

2. Install the required dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

3. Create a \`.env\` file in the project root with your API keys:
\`\`\`
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
NEWSAPI_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
\`\`\`

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Run the full pipeline (data collection, processing, and report generation):
\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`

### Specific Operations
Run only data collection:
\`\`\`bash
python main.py --collect
\`\`\`

Run only data processing:
\`\`\`bash
python main.py --process
\`\`\`

Generate risk reports from processed data:
\`\`\`bash
python main.py --report
\`\`\`

## Dependencies
* pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
* requests: API calls for data collection
* torch: Machine learning operations
* transformers: NLP models for sentiment analysis and risk classification
* datasets: Data handling for machine learning
* huggingface_hub: Access to pre-trained models
* python-dotenv: Environment variable management

## Future Improvements
* Fine-tune risk classification model on insurance-specific data
* Add geographic risk mapping and visualization
* Implement automated alerting for high-risk events
* Expand data sources for more comprehensive analysis
